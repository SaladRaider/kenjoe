If you are searching for a customized medication that most U.S. pharmacies can't provide, there may be a simple solution. Compounding pharmacies mix drugs individually for patients that need, say, a smaller dose, different formulation, or different delivery mechanism than what is available at ordinary retail pharmacies. If you are allergic to a common medication ingredient - such as gluten - cannot swallow pills due to a disability, or need to make a drug more palatable for a child or pet, Compounding Pharmacy Associates and Consultants (CPAC) might be your answer.
